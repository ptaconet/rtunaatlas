This package provides facilities to handle the public domain datasets of the 5 tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations. 
It was used to generate the datasets of the [FIRMS Global Tuna Atlas](https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/collection/firms-tuna-atlas). 

***This package is no longer maintained, but its scripts and functions were reused in the up-to-date [Geoflow-tuna repository](https://github.com/firms-gta/geoflow-tunaatlas)***

The data generated by these scripts are open and available here :
